# Task Completion Guidelines

When a task is completed, follow these steps:
1. Run `npm run lint` to ensure no linting errors.
2. Verify changes manually if they involve UI.
3. If new services or interfaces were added, ensures they follow the project's naming conventions.
4. Update the task list to reflect the completion.
5. Provide a summary of changes to the user.
